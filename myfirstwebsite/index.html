    <h1> How We Met </h1>
    <br>


        <p>Ariana and I met over the internet. A lot of people might think that this is the normal way
            nowadays, however, I don't think this actually is one of those stories. I had been in the US Marine for about three years before Arianna joined as well.
            Fornutately, she was stationed and assigned to the same unit I was in. I got to see her for the first time in 2015, and after only for brief moments while working around.
            I never had the guts to approach her because she was lower ranking than me, and I personally believed that it felt weird doing that. 
            My life went on, and she ended up leaving the Marines in 2017. In 2018, I decided to leave the military and move to Illinois. (terrible decision).
            I had recently called off and engagement with my ex fiance and I was just going to school. One day, she showed up on my facebook as a suggested friend, and I was feeling bold! 
            I decided to send her a friend request, after all, the worst thing she can do is deny my request. There was a brief moment where I honestly regretted sending her a request for multiple reasons. 
            My self-esteem wasn't up there  anymore, I had two kids under my belt with two different women, (yes,two different women) and the most important one of all, I lived in Illinois. She is originally from New York where she was living at the moment.
